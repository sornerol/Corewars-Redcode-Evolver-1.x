# Corewars-Redcode-Evolver-1.x
Corewars Redcode Evolver (CRE) 1.x is a program for generating "warrior" programs for the game Core War.

CRE 1.x is no longer being maintained. It was my first real project after learning how to code in C back in 2003 (as a high school sophomore). I'm placing it on GitHub for posterity's sake, but I have no intention of continuing development of CRE. I occasionally toy around with the idea of building a new redcode evolver, but so far not much has come of it. I will update this README if I ever get around to making a successor to CRE.
